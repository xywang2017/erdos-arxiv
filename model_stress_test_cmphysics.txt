Moiré materials are interesting for a number of reasons, stemming from their unique structure and the fascinating physical phenomena they exhibit:

Emergent Phenomena: Moiré materials are engineered by stacking and slightly misaligning atomically thin crystals. This creates a "moiré superlattice" with a larger periodicity, leading to emergent phenomena not present in the individual layers. This includes things like correlated insulating states, unconventional superconductivity, moiré ferroelectricity, and topological orbital ferromagnets. ([2404.08044v2])

Tunability: The properties of moiré materials can be easily tuned by adjusting the twist angle or applying external fields. This makes them ideal platforms for studying quantum phase transitions and exploring new phases of matter. ([2404.08044v2])

Topological Properties: Moiré materials often exhibit topological properties, which are robust against disorder and perturbations. This is because the moiré superlattice can induce nontrivial band topology, leading to phenomena like the Hofstadter's butterfly and the magic-angle effect. ([2310.15103v2], [2212.10827v1])

New Types of Insulators: Researchers have proposed and are actively studying new types of insulating states in moiré materials, such as the Chern texture insulator (CTI). These states break traditional symmetries in unique ways and could lead to new functionalities. ([2406.15342v1])

Quantum Simulation Platform: Moiré materials can be used to emulate other quantum systems, such as those found in solid-state materials and cold atoms. This opens up new possibilities for studying complex quantum phenomena in a more controlled setting. ([2310.15103v2])

Overall, moiré materials represent a rapidly developing field with the potential to revolutionize our understanding of condensed matter physics and lead to new technological advances in areas like quantum computing and sensing. ([2102.02644v1])

Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) can host a variety of correlated electronic phenomena. For example, AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 heterobilayers can give rise to topological moiré bands under an applied displacement field [2107.02167v3]. These valley-contrasting Chern bands with non-trivial spin textures arise from the interlayer hybridization of MoTe2 and WSe2 bands with opposite spins.
