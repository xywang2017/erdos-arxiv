Here are three key findings from the paper "Linguistic laws in biology" (arXiv:2310.07387v1):

Linguistic laws are found across multiple levels of biological organization. The authors state that biologists have discovered patterns consistent with linguistic laws in a wide range of biological systems, "from molecular (genomes, genes, and proteins) to organismal (animal behavior) to ecological (populations and ecosystems)". This suggests that these laws might reflect fundamental principles of organization in nature.
A new conceptual framework is proposed for studying linguistic laws in biology. Semple, Ferrer-i-Cancho, and Gustison propose a framework with "distinct levels of analysis, from description to prediction to theory building." This framework aims to provide a more structured and comprehensive approach to investigating the presence and significance of linguistic laws in biological systems.
Unifying linguistic laws and core theory in biology is a key goal. The paper argues that applying this new framework can provide "critical new insights into the fundamental rules of organization underpinning natural systems, unifying linguistic laws and core theory in biology." This suggests that linguistic laws may not just be interesting observations, but could hold the key to deeper understanding of biological organization itself.

The second finding refers to the discovery that patterns consistent with linguistic laws appear "across multiple levels of biological organisation" (2310.07387v1).

This means that the statistical patterns we see in human language are not limited to language itself, but can also be observed in various biological systems. The authors list examples of these levels, including:

Molecular: This refers to patterns within biological molecules like genomes, genes, and proteins. For instance, the arrangement of nucleotides in DNA or the sequence of amino acids in proteins might exhibit similar statistical regularities as those found in the arrangement of words in sentences.
Organismal (animal behavior): This level examines patterns in the behavior of individual organisms. Examples could include the sequence of actions an animal takes when foraging for food or the patterns in their vocalizations.
Ecological (populations and ecosystems): This level extends the analysis to interactions between organisms and their environment. This could involve examining the distribution of species within a habitat or the patterns of interactions within a food web.
The discovery of these patterns across different levels of biological organization suggests a potential for a unifying principle underlying the organization of complex systems in biology, similar to how linguistic laws govern the structure of human language.
