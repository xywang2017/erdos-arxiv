- QUERY: "correlated phenomena"

Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) displays a range of correlated phenomena, particularly at the magic angle (~1.1 degrees), due to the emergence of flat electronic bands. These flat bands enhance electron-electron interactions, leading to various correlated states. Here's a summary based on the provided research:

Correlation driven by flat bands: As explained in (1905.07316v2), TBG with a magic angle exhibits isolated flat bands at the Fermi level. This characteristic is crucial because it amplifies electron-electron interactions, making TBG a fertile ground for exploring strongly correlated electronic phenomena.

Insulating states and nematicity: (1901.02997v1) uses scanning tunneling microscopy to directly visualize these correlations. At half-filling of the flat bands, correlated insulating states emerge, characterized by the development of energy gaps. Near charge neutrality, a distinct correlated regime appears with enhanced flat band splitting, suggesting a strong tendency towards nematic ordering – a state where electronic interactions break the rotational symmetry of the system.

Impact of twist angle disorder: While flat bands drive correlation, (1908.02753v2) highlights how inevitable variations in the twist angle across real-world TBG samples (twist angle disorder) act as a unique type of disorder. This disorder significantly affects the energy gaps and bandwidth of the minibands arising from the moiré superlattice. Understanding this is crucial as it directly impacts the observability and robustness of correlated phases in TBG.

Role of interlayer coupling: (1903.05232v2) emphasizes that strong electron correlations in TBG stem from a synergistic effect between the large moiré cell and strong interlayer coupling. They show that decreasing the interlayer spacing (stronger coupling) enhances correlation, even in medium-sized moiré cells. This highlights the tunability of electronic correlations in TBG.

Electrostatic interactions and broken symmetry: (2109.06038v1) delves into the role of long-range electrostatic interactions in TBG. They find that these interactions significantly influence band structure and can lead to various broken-symmetry phases, including valley/spin polarized states and those with broken sublattice symmetry. These findings underscore the richness of possible phases in TBG due to the interplay between electronic correlations and long-range interactions.

In conclusion, TBG serves as an excellent platform for studying correlated phenomena. The interplay of flat bands, twist angle disorder, interlayer coupling, and electrostatic interactions leads to a rich landscape of correlated states, including insulating phases, nematicity, and various broken symmetry states.
