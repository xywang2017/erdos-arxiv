Based on the provided abstracts, here are some proposed models for FRB 20180916B, particularly focusing on its 16.35-day periodicity:

1. Precession Models:

    Disk-driven jet precession (2108.08982v1): This model suggests the FRB's periodicity arises from a precessing jet powered by an accretion disk. However, it requires an extremely low viscosity parameter (α≲10⁻⁸), making it implausible.
    Tidal force-driven jet precession (2108.08982v1): This model proposes a compact binary system comprising a neutron star/black hole and a Roche-lobe filling white dwarf. The tidal forces from the white dwarf on the accretion disk cause the jet to precess. This model can accommodate the 16.35-day period and predicts periods ranging from days to hundreds of days depending on the binary parameters.

2. Other Models:

    Narrow beam within a precessing cone (2012.15354v3): This model suggests the periodic modulation could be due to a narrow emission beam from the source rotating within a larger precession cone, similar to what's observed in X-ray binaries.
    Magnetar (2011.03257v3): While not directly addressing the periodicity, this study analyzes the environment of FRB 20180916B. They find that its projected distance from a likely birthplace is more consistent with the ages of high-mass X-ray binaries and gamma-ray binaries than with the shorter lifespans of magnetars.

Important Considerations:

    Universality of coherent emission (2012.15354v3): The detection of FRB 200428 from a seemingly isolated neutron star suggests that the mechanisms for producing coherent emission could be present in various environments.
    Multiband observations (2111.02382v2): Studying FRBs across multiple wavelengths provides crucial information about their energy distributions, emission mechanisms, and potential changes over time.

Conclusion:

The exact nature and source of FRB 20180916B are still under investigation. While the tidal force-driven jet precession model seems promising for explaining its periodicity, more observations and research are needed to confirm any model definitively.
