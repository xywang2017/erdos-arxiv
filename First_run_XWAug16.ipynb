INTRODUCTION\\nFast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio pulses of extragalactic origins (see Petroff et al. 2022 for\\na recent review on FRBs). Their properties have inspired numerous theories to explain their origin (see Platts et al.\\n2019 for review1). A luminous radio burst detected from SGR J1935+2154 (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020a;\\nBochenek et al. 2020) in 2020 April suggests that magnetars are likely progenitors for some of these sources. Some\\nFRBs are seen to repeat i.e, multiple bursts from the same source. After the publication of the Canadian Hydrogen\\nIntensity Mapping Experiment/Fast Radio Bursts (CHIME/FRB) first catalogue (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al.\\n2021), the number of published FRBs has surpassed over 600. Out of which 51 show repeat bursts (CHIME/FRB\\nCollaboration et al. 2019; Fonseca et al. 2020; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2023) in subsequent observations.\\nFRB 20180916B is one of the first repeating sources discovered by the CHIME/FRB collaboration (CHIME/FRB\\nCollaboration et al. 2019), who later showed it exhibits a 16.33-day periodicity in its activity (CHIME/FRB Collab-\\noration et al. 2020b). It has been localized to a nearby spiral galaxy approximately 150 Mpc away by Marcote et al.\\n(2020). The source is active for approximately five days in its 16.33-day cycle (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al.\\n2020b). This activity is frequency-dependent, with higher frequency detections occurring at earlier phases (Pastor-\\nMarazuela et al. 2021; Pleunis et al. 2021). The source has been detected over a wide frequency range, from 110 MHz\\nby the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) (Pastor-Marazuela et al. 2021; Pleunis et al. 2021; Gopinath et al. 2023) to 6\\nGHz by the Effelsberg telescope (Bethapudi et al. 2022) at different activity phases. This chromatic periodicity has led\\nto multiple progenitor scenarios involving precessing (e.g., Li & Zanazzi 2021), rotating (e.g., Beniamini et al. 2020)\\nor binary systems (e.g., Wada et al. 2021). The first repeating source, FRB 20121102A, has also shown a tentative\\nactivity period of around 160 days (Rajwade et al. 2020; Cruces et al. 2021).\\nUnderstanding the evolution of source properties with time can help further narrow down the models capable of\\nexplaining the activity period and emission origins. The distinctive ability of CHIME/FRB to monitor the entire\\nNorthern sky at a daily cadence makes it an ideal instrument for such a study. Rotation measure (RM) variation\\nhas been observed for FRB 20121102A over 2.5 years, decreasing by almost 34% its initial value (Michilli et al. 2018;\\nHilmarsson et al. 2021). This variation was accompanied by a four pc cm−3 increase in the dispersion measure (DM).\\nThe RM of FRB 20180916B is four orders of magnitude less than that of FRB 20121102A and was fairly stable until 2021\\nApril. Mckinven et al. (2023) reported a linear increase in the RM of FRB 20180916B in their recent CHIME/FRB\\npolarimetric data analysis. No significant DM changes have been observed for the source so far. Gopinath et al.\\n(2023) also observed these changes at LOFAR frequencies (150 MHz). This suggests a change in the magnetic field\\nenvironment in the source proximity that is independent of the mechanism causing the periodic activity.\\nScattering is another crucial property useful in understanding the source environment. Most FRB scattering times are\\nlonger than what is expected from their Galactic contribution (Cordes et al. 2016; Cordes & Chatterjee 2019). Chawla\\net al. (2022) showed that scattering in FRBs is likely due to their more extreme circumburst environments compared to\\nthose of pulsars in the Galactic plane. Contributions from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of intervening galaxies\\ncan also add to the total measured scattering (Vedantham & Phinney 2019).\\nFRB 20180916B has a low Galactic\\nlatitude and most of its scattering, as determined using scintillation bandwidth measurements, has been attributed\\nto the Milky Way (Marcote et al. 2020; Bethapudi et al. 2022). However, bursts with scattering tails considerably\\nlonger than the expected value from the Milky Way intestellar medium (ISM) have been observed in low frequency\\nobservations, suggesting possible contributions from the immediate source environment (Pleunis et al. 2021; Sand et al.\\n1 https://frbtheorycat.org/index.php/Main Page\\nRate and morphology evolution of FRB 20180916B\\n3\\n2022; Gopinath et al. 2023). Thus understanding the long-term and phase-dependent variation in scattering behavior\\nof the source can in principle help better characterize its immediate environment.\\nRepeating FRBs tend to have complex burst morphologies (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019; Fonseca et al.\\n2020; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2023). In particular, the downward-drifting “sad trombone” effect is a char-\\nacteristic feature of their dynamic spectra (Hessels et al. 2019; Pleunis et al. 2021). This may sometimes prevent the\\naccurate estimation of both DM and scattering values. FRB 20180916B exhibits microstructure at 1.7 GHz as narrow\\nas 3 µs (Nimmo et al. 2021) and down to 800 MHz as narrow as 30 µs (Sand et al. 2022). Such structures might\\nremain hidden at lower time resolution and can contaminate scattering estimates. Moreover, studying such structures\\ncan constrain the source’s emission models. Microstructures as narrow as 60 ns have been seen for FRB 20200120E\\n(Nimmo et al. 2022) at 1.4 GHz, suggesting a magnetically powered emission mechanism that can generate energies\\ncomparable to FRBs at ∼µs timescales. Past studies in the CHIME band (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020b;\\nPleunis et al. 2021) of this source have had insufficient time resolution to detect microstructure. FRB 20180916B ’s less\\nturbulent immediate environment compared to other active repeaters such as FRB 20121102A (Pleunis et al. 2021)\\nmakes it an ideal source for such a study. Identifying microsecond variations in the burst envelope to accurately esti-\\nmate the DM and scattering requires high time resolution, available only with raw voltage data that can be coherently\\ndedispersed. By ‘raw voltage’ we mean the complex voltage induced by the incoming electromagnetic radiation in the\\ntelescope feed. This allows us to extract phase information. We can then use this to completely remove the effects of\\ndispersion by coherent dedispersion to out best estimate of DM. The CHIME/FRB baseband system (CHIME/FRB\\nCollaboration et al. 2018; Michilli et al. 2021) provides such functionality, enabling the comprehensive study of these\\nultra-fast emissions on a population scale and for individual repeating sources down to 2.56 µs.\\nRepetition rates of repeaters are useful in understanding their activity which can give clues into possible progenitors.\\nFor example, a rate of more than 100 bursts per hour has been observed for FRB 20121102A (Li et al. 2021a) at 1.3 GHz.\\nSuch high rates put limits on the energy budget of the source. Sources like FRB 20201124A (Lanman et al. 2022) and\\nFRB 20220912A (Mckinven & CHIME/FRB Collaboration 2022) have shown sudden activity with repetition rates of\\ntens to hundreds of bursts per hour, respectively. Although transiting daily in the CHIME/FRBs field of view, no burst\\nabove our detection threshold had been detected from these sources despite a lot of exposure before their heightened\\nactivity periods. FRB 20180916B , on the other hand, has been detected continuously at the expected period since its\\ndiscovery by CHIME/FRB in 2018. However, a comprehensive study on the evolution of its long-timescale emission\\nrate until now has only been done at LOFAR frequencies (Gopinath et al. 2023).\\nHere we present a morphology analysis of 45 bursts from FRB 20180916B detected by the CHIME/FRB baseband\\nsystem from its first detection in 2018 September 16 to 2021 December 31. We use the same baseband burst sample\\npublished by Mckinven et al. (2023), where they report the polarization properties. In addition, we present burst\\nproperties for 15 bursts that have been detected only with intensity data since the last published results for the source\\n(Pleunis et al. 2021). We also analyze the evolution of the burst rate of the source and the burst count distribution with\\nrespect to its activity cycles in the aforementioned date range. In Section 2, we provide a brief outline of CHIME/FRB\\nand the CHIME/FRB baseband system used for our observations. In Section 3, we present the analysis and the results,\\nproviding a detailed outline of our Baseband morphology pipeline. In Section 4, we discuss the implications of our\\nresults. Lastly, we provide concluding remarks in Section 5.\\n2. OBSERVATIONS\\nCHIME is an array of four stationary cylinders, each 100 m × 20 m in dimensions, located near Penticton, British\\nColumbia. Along the axis of each cylinder are hung 256 equispaced feeds recording dual polarization in the frequency\\nrange 400-800 MHz for the overhead sky (CHIME Collaboration et al. 2022). The system was designed to map the\\ndistribution of neutral hydrogen in the redshift range 0.8-2.5 (Amiri et al. 2023). However, its daily Northern sky\\ncoverage and high sensitivity make it an excellent FRB detection machine.\\nThe CHIME/FRB backend uses the CHIME telescope to search for FRBs in real time as the sky transits\\n(CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2018). This process involves a comprehensive set of stages, from dedispersion\\nto Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) cleaning (Rafiei-Ravandi & Smith 2022), beam grouping, known source sifting\\nand finally, data callbacks for signals deemed astrophysical. The system stores intensity data for all FRB sources at\\na resolution of 0.983 ms and 16384 frequency channels (i.e., 24.4 kHz in frequency resolution). A detailed analysis of\\n536 of these sources was published by CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2021). Optimized for FRB searching, this\\nsystem is restricted in time resolution and does not store polarization information.\\n4\\nSand et al.\\nFor this reason, CHIME/FRB has a separate triggered baseband system (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2018).\\nThis system records buffered raw voltage data when an FRB is detected above a specified S/N threshold. The system\\nhas a data buffer of 20 seconds, permitting the recording of CHIME’s full bandwidth for a DM of upto 1000 pc\\ncm−3. This allows us to coherently dedisperse the voltage data around the detected DM and study the bursts at a\\ntime resolution of 2.56 µs. More details on the pipeline can be found in Michilli et al. (2021). The baseband data\\nalso permit analysis of Stokes parameters and extraction of polarization information, the specifics of which have been\\npresented by Mckinven et al. (2021).\\nIn this study, all the 45 baseband bursts from FRB 20180916B were beamformed at the published VLBI position of\\nthe source (Marcote et al. 2020). Additionally, there are 15 bursts with only total intensity data. These were mostly\\nlow S/N and hence did not trigger the baseband system.\\n3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS\\nAll the new bursts in our dataset were identified using the clustering algorithm described by CHIME/FRB Collab-\\noration et al. (2023). Among the baseband burst sample, we re-analyze the morphological properties of 21 previously\\npublished bursts (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020b; Pleunis et al. 2021). The remaining 24 bursts in the sample\\nare new detections.\\nFigures 8 and 9 in the Appendix show our burst sample with baseband data, with Table 1 listing their measured\\nproperties. Figure 10 show the new detections with only intensity data with measured morphological properties listed\\nin Table 2.\\n3.1. Baseband Morphology Pipeline\\nThe baseband morphology pipeline is designed to fit a model to the data with morphological parameters such as\\nburst width, scattering, bandwidth, arrival time, and DM from bursts detected by the baseband system. This pipeline\\ninteracts with Stokes intensity (I) data products in the final beamformed file, and a single tied-array beam is formed\\nat the best known sky position of the given source (Michilli et al. 2021, 2022).\\nThe pipeline has three main parts. See Figure 1 for a graphical representation of the pipeline workflow.\\nThe first part starts with performing RFI excision using the functionalities described by Michilli et al. (2021).\\nThe burst is then dedispersed at its structure-maximising DM, calculated using the DM phase package (Seymour et al.\\n2019). The pulse profile is then smoothed by applying locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) implemented\\nby statsmodels (Seabold & Perktold 2010). LOWESS is a non-parametric regression method that weights a data\\nneighborhood with some kernel. Thus, the only parameter it requires is the neighborhood size for smoothing, also\\nknown as the smoothing fraction. A small neighborhood will smooth very little, while a large neighborhood will smooth\\na lot. The pipeline typically uses a neighborhood size of 1.5% - 20% of the profile estimated using an algorithm that\\nconsiders burst properties such as S/N, time resolution, and pulse width. This smoothed profile is then used to estimate\\nthe number of burst components using find peaks implemented by SciPy (Virtanen et al. 2020).\\nThe second step focuses on getting initial guesses for the burst profile and its spectrum. We fit a sum of Exponentially\\nModified Gaussians (EMG) to the entire burst profile, with one term per sub-burst i, and with the scattering timescale\\nfixed for all sub-bursts. We define the EMG as follows:\\nEMG(x; Ai; µi; σi; τ) =\\nN\\nX\\ni=1\\nAi\\n1\\n2τ exp\\n\\x12 1\\n2τ\\n\\x10\\n2µi + σi\\nτ 2 −2x\\n\\x11\\x13\\n· erfc\\n \\nµ2\\ni + σ2\\ni\\nτ −x\\n2√σi\\n!\\n,\\n(1)\\nwhere x is the input time series, A is the amplitude, µ is the Gaussian mean, σ is the variance and τ is the scattering\\ntime scale for each of the N components.\\nThe 1D spectrum of each sub-burst is fit with a Running Power Law (RPL) defined as follows\\nRPLi(f; Ai; ri; γi) = Ai(f/fo)−γi+riln(f/fo),\\n(2)\\nwhere fo is an arbitrary reference frequency chosen to be the middle of the band at 600 MHz, r is the spectral running,\\nand γ is the spectral index. The spectral model is identical to the one described by CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al.\\n(2021).\\nUsing these models, first, a non-linear least-squares algorithm curve fit from SciPy is used to get initial conditions\\nfor the steps (walkers) of each of the Markov chains. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm\\nRate and morphology evolution of FRB 20180916B\\n5\\nis then implemented using the emcee routine (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) using independent wide uniform prior\\ndistributions for all parameters. We use a chi squared log-likelihood function. The MCMC process is quite fast (up\\nto a few minutes, depending on the time resolution of the data), therefore it can be easily run multiple times until\\nthe posterior has converged. However, note that this depends on the quality of the data being fit. Very low S/N data\\nmay not converge quickly, in which case, we would increase the downsampling factor (i.e. reduce the time resolution)\\nin order to increase the S/N. Once the downsampling has been increased enough, we can adjust the chain length and\\nnumber of walkers to convergence.\\nIn the third and final step, the EMG and RPL fit parameters obtained for the time series and the spectrum,\\nrespectively, are passed on to fitburst, that performs a 2-D fit on the dataset, as described in the following section.\\n3.1.1. Fitburst\\nFitburst is a least-squares optimization routine that models the burst morphology and dynamic spectrum. The\\nmodel includes all the fundamental burst parameters: DM, the time of arrival (tarr) in the given data file, the signal\\namplitude (A), temporal width (σ), power-law spectral index (γ), ‘running’ of the spectral index (r), and scattering\\ntimescale of the signal (τ). For a signal with N components, the DM and scattering timescale are set to be same for\\neach of the sub-bursts, with 2 + 5N parameters being fitted through χ2 optimization. The resulting mathematical\\nformulation can be found in CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2021) (see Eqns. 1 and 2 of Section 3.3).\\nThe routine computes a noise weighted fit residual using following equation:\\nht,f(λ) = dt,f\\nσf\\n−St,f(λ).\\n(3)\\nHere dt,f is the data as a function of discrete time and frequency channel, λ is the set of fit parameters described\\nabove, σf is the standard deviation in the noise calculated for each frequency channel, and St,f is the model. Fitburst\\nthen employs the optimize.least squares functionality of scipy to minimize χ2(λ) = Σt,f[ht,f(λ)]2 with respect to\\nmodel parameters. The uncertainties on the resulting fit parameters are computed using the covariance in the resulting\\nχ2 fit provided by the solver. This involves a Jacobian matrix comprised of partial derivatives of the fit equation at\\nthe minimized fit parameter values. More information about fitburst can be found in CHIME/FRB Collaboration\\net al. (2021) and Pleunis et al. (2021). A more detailed description will be forthcoming (Fonseca et al. in prep), along\\nwith a public release of the codebase.\\nWe report morphological parameters for the intensity and baseband bursts using fitburst, the only difference\\nbetwee the two being that the initial guesses for DM, burst width etc., for the intensity burst fits are computed using\\nthe methodology described by CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2021). For baseband bursts, we do not keep the DM\\nfixed at its structure maximizing value during fitting by fitburst but rather permit an offset in DM, making it a free\\nparameter. This was done to obtain an optimized model for the burst parameters. We report this optimized value in\\nTable 1.\\n3.2. Simulations\\nTo obtain robust uncertainty estimates, we undertook simulations to better characterize the fitting results from\\nfitburst for all the baseband bursts. These simulations consisted of synthetic bursts generated using the simpulse\\n2 routine (Merryfield et al. 2023).\\nThe spectro-temporal properties of the simulated bursts mimic the measured\\nparameters (see Table 1). For each of the 45 bursts, we generated 50 synthetic bursts each integrated into an array\\nof random noise. fitburst was then run on the entire sample, and the measured value for each successful run was\\nsaved. We calculated the standard deviations of the measured parameters and then calculated the relative uncertainty\\nwith respect to simulated values. Finally, we scaled the error measurements in scattering and width for every burst in\\nour sample by the relative uncertainty computed from the simulations. We repeated the entire process three times to\\nverify our results. This yielded robust uncertainties, resulting in better characterization of the temporal evolution of\\nmorphological properties as described below.\\n3.3. Period and Period Derivative Analysis\\n2 https://github.com/kmsmith137/simpulse\\n6\\nSand et al.\\nFigure 1. Flowchart showing the Baseband Morphology Pipeline. Path on the left involves extracting the Stokes Intensity\\n(I) data products from the beamformed file, dedispersing and cleaning the spectra, getting the burst profile and estimating the\\nnumber of sub-bursts/peaks to fit for. The middle portion indicates the process of extracting initial guesses on the temporal\\nprofile of each sub-burst, first by a Least Square (LS) fit and then by MCMC sampling using an Exponential Modified Gaussian\\n(EMG). As indicated in the right hand column we then estimate the spectral parameters using the same methods assuming a\\nRunning Power Law (RPL) model. The resulting datafile along with initial guesses are then provided to fitburst.\\nWe recalculated the period of FRB 20180916B using the arrival time of the new detections presented here and the\\nupdated exposure. The total on-sky exposure of the source from 2018 August 28 to 2021 December 31 was computed\\nusing the procedure described by CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2021).\\nIn summary, we record metrics that\\nindicate the variation in up-time and sensitivity of the CHIME/FRB system for the given interval. These metrics\\nare combined with the beam model 3 to generate exposure maps, which we query at the VLBI position of the source\\n(Marcote et al. 2020). Note that we only calculate exposure if the sky location lies within the FWHM of the beam at\\n600 MHz. The total exposure on the source in the aforementioned time interval is 201 hours, in which we detected 94\\nbursts.\\nWe used the Pearson χ2 test described by CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2020b) to estimate the best period.\\nThe updated period is 16.34 ± 0.07 days, assuming the period derivative to be zero. We have used this period in all of\\nour phase calculations. The source period has thus not changed prior to 2021 December 31 and is similar to the one\\nreported by CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2020b) and Pleunis et al. (2021). To constrain the period derivative,\\nwe modified our phase calculation term as follows\\nϕ = t −to\\nP\\n+ 1\\n2\\n \\n−˙\\nP\\nP 2\\n!\\n(t −to)2,\\n(4)\\nwhere ϕ is the phase, to is the reference Modified Julian Date (MJD) (in this case 58369.40), P is the period and ˙\\nP\\nis the period derivative. We then calculate χ2 values again for each period and period derivative combination. Figure\\n2 shows our χ2 distribution, and we perform a 2-D Gaussian fit on it using the Astropy package. In this way, we\\nfind P = 16.34 ± 0.32 days and ˙\\nP = −0.2 ± 1.5 × 10−4 day day−1. This is consistent with the derivative being zero.\\nThe above analysis used 8 phase bins, but we find similar order of magnitude results for up to 200 bins. Longer-term\\nmonitoring may eventually reveal a non-zero ˙\\nP.\\n3.4.

Distribution of burst counts for FRB 20180916B . The left panel shows the number of bursts detected during each\\nactivity cycle. One activity cycle is defined as a period of 16.34 days (starting August 2018). In total, we have 74 activity\\ncycles observed by CHIME/FRB from 2018 August to 2021 December. The right panel shows the frequency distribution of the\\nburst count in each activity cycle in dark green. We also show a distribution from 10000 simulations in light green sampled\\nassuming a Poissionian process with mean rate equal to the value we have observed. We performed a KS and AD test between\\nthe observed and simulated distributions and report the median p-value, 0.512 and 0.12 respectively. See section 3.4 for details.\\n8\\nSand et al.\\nNext we do an analysis of the rate of bursts from FRB 20180916B in the CHIME band. After excising the bursts\\ndetected during days of low sensitivity and those detected outside the FWHM at 600 MHz, we are left with 40 bursts\\nin our rate analysis.\\nThe exposure for each activity cycle was calculated by folding the daily exposure data using a period of 16.34 days.\\nWe have had 74 activity cycles since the source’s discovery in 2018 September up to the end of 2021. Figure 3 (left)\\nshows the burst count in each cycle. To test whether the counts are consistent with being drawn from a Poissonian\\ndistribution, we used a Kolomogrov-Smirnoff (KS) test (Massey Jr 1951) and an Anderson-Darling (AD) test (Scholz\\n& Stephens 1987). Figure 3 (right) shows the frequency distribution of the counts in dark green. We simulated 10000\\ninstances of a Poisson process, assuming a mean rate equal to the observed mean count of bursts, 1.27 events per\\nactivity period. We performed a KS and AD test for each distribution with our observed count distribution. Our\\nmedian p-values, 0.512 (KS) and 0.12 (AD), shows that the observed counts distribution is consistent with being\\nPoissonian at 95% confidence.\\nWe then estimated the burst rate for each activity cycle, as shown in Figure 4. There, error bars represent 95%\\nconfidence uncertainties assuming a Poissonian process within each cycle. As the telescope sensitivity varies across\\ncycles, the rate for each cycle is scaled to a fluence threshold of 5.2 Jy ms by using an index of γ = −2.3 (CHIME/FRB\\nCollaboration et al. 2020b). This threshold was calculated using the methodology described by Josephy et al. (2019).\\nWe see that the source’s activity is consistent with a single Poisson rate throughout the three years of this study. The\\nmean rate throughout the observation period is 0.2+0.1\\n−0.1 bursts per hour.\\nThe count and rate distribution with respect to phase is shown in Figure 5. We divide the active phase into three\\nsub-intervals. The rate centered around the peak activity of the source (0.45–0.55) is 0.86+0.5\\n−0.35 burst per hour at a\\nfluence threshold of 5.2 Jy ms. However the differences are not statiscally siginificant with rates during earlier phases\\n(0.35–0.45) of 0.82+0.51\\n−0.35 or later phases (0.55–0.65) of 0.24+0.33\\n−0.16 burst per hour. We might observe significant differences\\nin phase dependent rates with more detections in the future.\\n0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\n8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 62 64 66 68 70 72\\nActivity cycle\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\nBurst rate (burst/hr)\\nMean rate 0.2+0.1\\n0.1 burst/hr\\nFigure 4.

Here\\nwe have excised the bursts detected during days of low sensitivity and those detected outside the FWHM at 600 MHz to get\\ntrue estimate on the rate. The rate is maximum in the phase range 0.45-0.55 (green). We also show the rates in phases earlier\\ni.e 0.35-0.45 (blue) and later, i.e., 0.55-0.65 (red). The three rates are consistent within error bars (95%) assuming a Poissonian\\nprocess. See Section 3.4 for details.\\nthe bursts from the baseband sample were used in this analysis as their spectral and temporal properties are better\\nconstrained.\\nMckinven et al. (2023) reported a systematic linear increase in RM as shown in third panel of Figure 6. However,\\ninterestingly, we do not find any corresponding change in any other properties.\\nWe performed an Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test on DM values to test the time dependence.\\nThe ADF\\nestimates a regression equation and checks if the regression coefficient applied to a lagged time series variable is\\nsignificantly different from unity (Dickey & Fuller 1979).\\nIt tests the null hypothesis that a time series is non-\\nstationary. With a p-value of ∼10−8, we find the DM is stationary and see no clear evolution with time, even during\\nthe corresponding RM evolution. The DM of the brightest burst in our dataset, B35, is 348.81 ± 0.01 pc cm−3, which\\nis 0.04 pc cm−3 greater than what was reported by Nimmo et al. (2021) (348.772 ± 0.001 pc cm−3) . The DM we\\nmeasure for different bursts requiring lower time resolution can be affected by underlying unresolved structure. We\\nconstrain the DM variation to ≲1 pc cm−3.\\nThe scattering timescale shows significant variation from burst to burst. However, in our ADF test, we do not\\nobserve any trend in this variation (p-value ∼10−10). We also do not see any phase dependence. Similarly, the widths\\nalso show stochastic variation with no particular trend, with the broadest burst being 6 ms. However, there are caveats\\nregarding our measurements: weaker bursts are at lower time resolution. For bursts B4-B5 and B10-B11 (see Table\\n1), we see significant changes in the scattering value within the same CHIME transit. However, the bursts are not\\nbright enough to resolve structure narrower than ∼160 µs, which could affect our scattering estimates. Such sudden\\nchanges have also been claimed for FRB 20190520B (Ocker et al. 2023) and have been attributed to fluctuations in\\nthe turbulence in proximity to the circumburst environment.\\nIn terms of spectral properties, we find that most of the bursts are narrow-band, as is also seen for all other repeaters\\n(Pleunis et al. 2021; Kumar et al. 2021). The average bandwidth in the CHIME band is ∼150 MHz, with the narrowest\\n10\\nSand et al.\\n58600\\n58800\\n59000\\n59200\\n59400\\n59600\\nMJD\\n0\\n1\\n2\\nScattering(ms)\\n0.35\\n0.40\\n0.45\\n0.50\\n0.55\\n0.60\\n0.65\\nPhase\\n0\\n10\\nCount\\n58600\\n58800\\n59000\\n59200\\n59400\\n59600\\nMJD\\n348\\n349\\n350\\n351\\nDM(pc/cc)\\n0.35\\n0.40\\n0.45\\n0.50\\n0.55\\n0.60\\n0.65\\nPhase\\n0\\n10\\nCount\\n58600\\n58800\\n59000\\n59200\\n59400\\n59600\\nMJD\\n120\\n100\\n80\\n60\\nRM(rad/m2)\\n0.35\\n0.40\\n0.45\\n0.50\\n0.55\\n0.60\\n0.65\\nPhase\\n0\\n25\\nCount\\n58600\\n58800\\n59000\\n59200\\n59400\\n59600\\nMJD\\n500\\n600\\n700\\nCF(MHz)\\n0.35\\n0.40\\n0.45\\n0.50\\n0.55\\n0.60\\n0.65\\nPhase\\n0\\n10\\nCount\\n58600\\n58800\\n59000\\n59200\\n59400\\n59600\\nMJD\\n100\\n200\\n300\\nBW(MHz)\\n0.35\\n0.40\\n0.45\\n0.50\\n0.55\\n0.60\\n0.65\\nPhase\\n0\\n5\\nCount\\n58600\\n58800\\n59000\\n59200\\n59400\\n59600\\nMJD\\n0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\nWidth(ms)\\n0.35\\n0.40\\n0.45\\n0.50\\n0.55\\n0.60\\n0.65\\nPhase\\n0\\n10\\nCount\\n2\\n5\\n10\\n20\\n40\\n81\\n163\\n327\\n655\\n1310\\nTime-resolution ( s)\\nFigure 6.

The bottom panel shows the temporal ACF (black),\\nLorentzian fit to the ACF (green dashed), the residual (blue) and ACF of the noise (red). We find a weak peak in the ACF with\\nwidth of ∼50µs but cannot constrain the true nature of this structure with the present dataset. See Section 3.6 for details.\\nSome FRBs have shown temporal microstructure. For FRB 20180916B , we have seen structures as narrow as 3 µs at\\n1.7 GHz (Nimmo et al. 2021) and 30 µs at 800 MHz (Sand et al. 2022). The bursts need to be coherently dedispersed\\nand bright enough at finer time resolution for such narrow structure to be detectable. We selected 11 bursts from our\\ndata that were visible at a resolution of 80 µs or less (maximum downsample of 32, Table 1).\\nWe analysed the burst structure using a temporal auto-correlation function (ACF). ACF is a useful tool for studying\\nthese ultra-fast emission features. First, we summed over the sub-bands in which the burst was detected. We then\\nperformed the ACF in time of the pulse profile of these bursts. We flagged the zero-lag peak, which inhibits the\\ndetection of narrow features in the ACF. We performed a Lorentzian fit on the wider burst envelope, which in this\\ncase corresponds roughly to the width of the burst.\\nOnly one of the bright bursts showed interesting feature in our sample. Figure 7 illustrates the analysis conducted\\nfor B20 within our sample. The error associated with the DM value for this burst was 0.009 pc cm−3 (refer to Table 1),\\ncorresponding to a smear time of approximately 80 µs within CHIME band. To account for this effect, we measured\\nthe ACF of the time profile at 100 DM steps ranging from -0.009 to 0.009 pc cm−3, centered around the optimal\\nDM value (348.781 pc cm−3). The figure displays the outcome at the DM value that maximizes our ACF, which is\\ncharacterized by the greatest separation between the second Lorentzian peak and the fit to the broader envelope. It is\\nto be noted that this DM value does not correspond to the true DM of the burst. We cannot reliable ascertain whether\\nthe peak is due to a microstructure or can be attributed to amplitude modulated noise which will create stronger\\n12\\nSand et al.\\npower on the one bin level. We redid the analysis at higher time resolution and the burst was too weak to extract any\\nreliable estimates. If real, detecting such features at 600 MHz opens the possibility of ultra-fast emission features in\\nbrighter detections from other sources in the CHIME band. The remaining bursts in our bright sample did not show\\nany interesting features in their ACF.\\n4. DISCUSSION\\n4.1. Burst rate evolution\\nActive repeaters have shown variations in their burst rates over time. The rate can change from less than one burst\\nper hour to more than 100 bursts per hour, as was observed for FRB 20121102A by Li et al. (2021a) in their 60 hours\\nof observations spanning 47 days at 1.2 GHz above a 7σ threshold of 0.015 Jy ms. Gajjar et al. (2018) also reported\\nclustered arrival times in their high frequency (4-8 GHz) study of the same source. Nimmo et al. (2023) also observed\\nthis behavior from FRB 20200120E, where they detected 53 bursts within 40 minutes, almost 80 bursts per hour.\\nBefore this epoch, the observed peak rate from the source was 0.4+2.0\\n−0.4 bursts per hour in their Effelsberg observations\\nat 1.4 GHz above a 7σ threshold of 0.05 Jy ms. These burst storms after a dormant period can be a characteristic\\nfeature of some repeating sources. Notably, these observations were at different frequencies and sensitivity thresholds,\\nmaking it harder to compare the rates and energy distributions among active repeaters.\\nCHIME/FRB, in its continuous monitoring, has been crucial in catching spontaneously active repeaters.\\nFRB\\n20201124A is a prime example (Lanman et al. 2022). After its initial discovery in 2020 November, it was not detected\\nabove our sensitivity threshold (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2021) and suddenly entered a high-activity period in\\n2021 April. Follow-up observations led to detections of thousands of bursts using multiple instruments, particularly by\\nthe Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) (Xu et al. 2022). Recently, FRB 20220912A (Mckinven\\n& CHIME/FRB Collaboration 2022) has shown similar behavior, with no bursts detected prior to 2022 September\\nfollowed by nine bursts in three CHIME/FRB transits, suggesting rates as high as 200-300 bursts per day. Higher\\nfrequency followups by GBT (Feng et al. 2023) and FAST (Zhang et al. 2023) confirmed this high burst rate for the\\nsource. Magnetars have also been known to exhibit burst storms at X-ray energies, with 100s of bursts per hour (e.g.,\\nYounes et al. 2020; Gavriil et al. 2002). SGR 1935+2154 is a prime example, but so far, we have only observed one\\nradio burst from this or any magnetar with a luminosity comparable to that of FRBs (CHIME/FRB Collaboration\\net al. 2020a; Bochenek et al. 2020).\\nWe do not see any episodes of heightened activity from FRB 20180916B , even after ∼200 hours of observation by\\nCHIME/FRB across the entire activity phase. Cycle-to-cycle variation has been observed within the same activity\\nphase from the source at other frequencies (Bethapudi et al. 2022; Pastor-Marazuela et al. 2021). However, in our\\nlong-term monitoring of the source, we find such variations to be consistent with being Poissonian in their distribution\\n(see Section 3.4). As shown in Figure 3, the burst count can vary from zero to five bursts from cycle to cycle, but such\\nbehavior is expected from a Poisson process of a mean rate of around 1.3 bursts per activity cycle. Figure 4 shows\\nthat the burst rate of the source is steady within 95% confidence uncertainty, assuming a Poissonian process in the\\nobserved 74 activity cycles. The source seems to have a steady rate, with no period of heightened activity, unlike what\\nhas been observed from other prolific repeaters. But the CHIME/FRB transit duration is ∼15 minutes; extended\\nexposure with a sensitive telescope might provide more insights into whether FRB 20180916B is prone to burst storms.\\nIn addition, the RM change observed in the source (Mckinven et al. 2023) does not coincide with any change in the\\nactivity of the source, suggesting that the secular rise observed likely has more to do with evolution in the propagation\\nenvironment rather than variations in the intrinsic nature of the source.\\nFRB 20180916B is known to be chromatic in its activity. Higher frequency bursts tend to be observed at earlier phases\\n(Bethapudi et al. 2022) and lower frequency bursts at later phases (Pleunis et al. 2021). This spectral dependence\\nmakes it difficult to estimate the full rate, across all frequencies, per cycle. In conjunction with the narrow band nature\\nof the bursts, this can lead to differences in rates as a function of phase within a specific frequency range. In Figure 5,\\nwe see that more bursts are detected at phases 0.45–0.55, but the overall rate of the source is consistent among activity\\nphase within the uncertainities. With more detections in the future, any difference in rate might become prominent\\nin the CHIME/FRB band.\\nAlongside rate, we find that the activity period of the source has not significantly varied with time since the source’s\\ndiscovery. Our estimate, based on data from 2018 August to 2021 December, the longest time span yet, is 16.34±0.07\\ndays (see Section 3.4), consistent with the original measurement of 16.35±0.15 days (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al.\\n2020b). This makes FRB 20180916B unique compared to other prominent repeaters. A stable period with no episodes\\nRate and morphology evolution of FRB 20180916B\\n13\\nof heightened activity might suggest a distinct progenitor scenario to what has been proposed for other active sources.\\nThis will be discussed in detail in Section 4.4.\\n4.2. Spectro-Temporal Properties\\nFRBs can have complex structures in their temporal profiles, often well described as multiple sub-bursts. Repeaters\\ngenerally show more such sub-bursts compared to apparent non-repeaters, as was first noticed in the first known\\nrepeater FRB 20121102A (Hessels et al. 2019). Bursts from repeating sources also tend to be wider and have narrower\\nbandwidths than for apparent one-off FRBs (Pleunis et al. 2021). Our burst sample from FRB 20180916B exhibits\\nthe same behavior. Most of our widths lie in the range 1–3 ms (see Table 1). Our bursts are wider than seen in high\\nfrequency detections at 6 GHz (∼0.3 ms) (Bethapudi et al. 2022) and narrower compared to LOFAR detections (∼40\\nms) (Pleunis et al. 2021; Pastor-Marazuela et al. 2021). Our average bandwidth of 150 MHz is narrower compared to\\nbandwidth > 500 MHz detections at high frequencies, a trend that has been seen for FRB 20180916B (Bethapudi et al.\\n2022) as well as FRB 20121102A (Gajjar et al. 2018; Hessels et al. 2019). We have observed sub-bursts as narrow as\\n78 µs (B20), suggesting there might be more sub-ms emissions from repeaters even at low frequencies. Additionally,\\nas shown in Figure 6, we find no temporal or phase dependence in burst width over the three-year timescale. We also\\ndo not find any significant bimodality in the peak emitting frequency from the source, unlike what has been observed\\nfor FRB 20201124A (Lanman et al. 2022).\\nScattering timescales trace inhomogeneities along the line of sight towards the source. FRB 20180916B ’s low Galactic\\nlatitude (b ∼3.7◦) implies a major contribution from the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM) to the scattering time.\\nThe expected scattering in the direction of FRB 20180916B at 600 MHz according to the NE2001 model (Cordes &\\nLazio 2002) for the Galactic electron distribution is ∼0.16 ms. Assuming that the frequency dependence of scattering\\ntime is a power law with index −4, we expect a scattering timescale of the order of ∼0.17 ms in the CHIME band,\\nextrapolating from the 2.7-µs scattering time reported by Marcote et al. (2020) at 1700 MHz using scintillation\\nbandwidth measurements. Chawla et al. (2020) report an upper limit of 1.7 ms at 350 MHz, corresponding to a\\nscattering timescale <0.2 ms at 600 MHz. Our scattering values range from 0.08 ms to 2.2 ms, suggesting time-\\nvariability in the medium causing the scattering. In our dataset, we observed bursts with scattering less than 0.16\\nms (see Table 1). However, our measured scattering might be contaminated by unresolved structure, since not all the\\nbursts in our sample are bright enough to be studied down to 2.56 µs (see Table 1). Most of the scattering observed\\nfrom FRB 20180916B has been attributed to the Milky Way ISM (Sand et al. 2022; Bethapudi et al. 2022; Marcote\\net al. 2020) using scintillation bandwidth measurements. Hence, the observed scattering profile for the source, if real,\\nmay not always follow a power-law index of −4, as expected from a thin screen model. Such deviations in the index\\nhave also been observed for Galactic pulsars (Lewandowski et al. 2015; Geyer et al. 2017). Bethapudi et al. (2022)\\nalso find tentative scattering variability from scintillation measurements; they attribute most of this to the refractive\\ntimescale of the Milky Way screen.\\nMicrostructures have been observed for many FRB sources, suggesting luminous ultra-fast emission (Nimmo et al.\\n2022). For FRB 20180916B , we have seen structures as narrow as 3 µs at 1700 MHz (Nimmo et al. 2021) and 30\\nµs at 800 MHz (Sand et al. 2022) which is in agreement with the prediction of Milky Way scattering from NE2001.\\nAlthough we did not find strong evidence for structure in this work, future studies should continue to search for short\\ntimescale structure from FRB 20180916B and other FRBs, especially those at higher galactic latitudes where Galactic\\nscattering should be even smaller. Detecting such structures will suggest an occasionally less turbulent environment\\nthat doesn’t inhibit the propagation of µs substructures by scattering, even at low frequencies. Microstructure also\\nfavors the emission origin to be magnetospheric instead of a shock wave interaction since the latter’s larger physical\\nscales do not naturally predict very short temporal behavior, whereas the former is inherently compact (Metzger et al.\\n2019; Lu et al. 2020).\\n4.3. Local Environment\\nRepeaters are a unique tool for understanding the immediate surroundings of FRBs, as they permit studies of short-\\nterm and long-term variability of DM, RM and scattering properties. The first repeating source FRB 20121102A was\\nproposed to be in a highly magnetized environment given its extremely high RM and association with a Persistent\\nRadio Source (PRS) (Michilli et al. 2018). Since then, there has been a secular decrease in RM from the source with\\nan increase in DM (Hilmarsson et al. 2021). This change can be explained by an FRB source within a magnetar wind\\nnebula, a pulsar orbiting a supermassive black hole or an evolving Supernova Remnant(SNR) (Margalit & Metzger\\n14\\nSand et al.\\n2018; Zhang 2018). RM variability has also been observed for FRB 20201124A (Xu et al. 2022; Hilmarsson et al. 2021)\\non timescales of weeks. A more extreme case of this has been shown by FRB 20190520B, where a reversal in RM\\nsign was observed (Dai et al. 2022; Anna-Thomas et al. 2022). Such variability can be attributed to variation in the\\nmagnetic field configuration close to the source region. Wang et al. (2022) suggest that these two sources might reside\\nin a magnetar/Be binary star system, with interaction from the Be star decretion disc producing these RM variations.\\nFRB 20180916B has a nominal RM, which was reasonably stable with stochastic variations, until recently when\\nMckinven et al. (2023) observed a secular rise in the value. We do not see any corresponding evolution in the DM of\\nthe source. Mckinven et al. (2023) attribute this to changes in the B∥of the local environment and put a limit of ≤4 pc\\non the size of the Faraday active medium. This is greater than the 1 pc upper limit on the compact radio counterpart\\nof FRB 20121102A (Plavin et al. 2022). Zhao et al. (2023) interpret the RM variation of FRB 20180916B as periastron\\npassage of a freely precessing magnetar in an orbital period of 1600–16000 day,s with no DM contribution from stellar\\nwind or disc. We do not see any changes in the scattering timescale that might hint at an interaction with a stellar\\nwind during the RM variation epochs. However, the mass loss rate of the companion star may be too low to discern\\nany significant changes.\\nWe find no obvious trend in the long-term variations in scattering, although burst-to-burst measurements tend to\\nvary. Interestingly for bursts B4-B5 and B10-B11, we observe large fluctuations in the measured scattering value within\\nthe same transit. Ocker et al. (2023) have also observed changes in scattering on short timescale (∼minutes) for FRB\\n20190520B. They attribute such behavior to a dynamic, inhomogeneous plasma in the circumsource environment and\\npredicted similar variations in other FRB sources. Though our measured values might not be physical scattering due to\\nthe possibility of underlying structures, we can put definitive limits at the given time resolution for respective bursts.\\nOverall this suggests that although FRB 20180916B has a cleaner circumburst medium compared to other sources,\\nwe can still expect considerable variations due to discrete plasma patches in the circumstellar medium (Ocker et al.\\n2023). Similar to us Gopinath et al. (2023) also observed large scattering changes (∼10 ms) in short timescale for\\nFRB 20180916B in their observation at 150 MHz using the LOFAR telescope. They also attributed these to variations\\nin the turbulence in the local environment. They do not find any phase dependence in scattering. We also do not\\nobserve any periodic dependence in scattering variability (see Figure 6). This seems at odds with strong binary wind\\ninteractions near the source if we assume that the 16-day periodicity is due to orbital motion. We also do not observe\\nany correlation between changes in scattering with DM for FRB 20180916B , unlike what has been seen for the Crab\\npulsar over its long-term monitoring (McKee et al. 2018). These correlations have been attributed to seeing different\\nsightlines through the nebula due to the pulsar’s proper motion, which traces the filamentary structure of the nebula.\\nThis suggests that FRB 20180916B might not reside in a Crab-like remnant, or may be older, with the remnant so\\ndissipated that it has lost its filamentary structure.\\n4.4. Constraints on Progenitors\\nThe periodic nature of FRB 20180916B has led to multiple progenitor theories. These can be broadly classified into\\ntwo types. The first type involves FRB emission from a compact object, where the period is due to rotation, or to\\nprecession (either of an isolated object or of one in a binary system). The second broad class invokes a compact object\\nin a binary orbit, where interactions with the companion wind or disk lead to FRB emission, and the orbital period\\nexplains the periodicity.\\n4.4.1. Rotation or Precession as the Origin of the Periodicity\\nThe rotation of an ultra-long period magnetar has been suggested to explain the periodicity (Beniamini et al. 2020).\\nIn this case, an isolated magnetar is slowed down to a 16-day rotation period by episodic mass loss in particle winds,\\nangular momentum kicks, or accretion due to a long-lasting fallback disk. The magnetar, in this case, would be of\\nage comparable to that of typical Galactic magnetars (∼1–10 kyr), which is consistent with the observed offset of the\\nsource from a star formation region in Hubble observations (Tendulkar et al. 2021). The stability of the period over the\\nthree years of our observations is consistent with this scenario; however, the constancy of the burst rate is somewhat\\nat odds with the usually more episodic magnetar bursting behavior. In this picture, we expect no phase-related DM\\nvariations and relatively constant polarization angles. However, we have not observed such long periods from any\\nGalactic magnetars/neutron stars, though a possibility of a 6.7-hour period has been proposed for the unusal X-ray\\nsource 1E 161348−5055 in the SNR RCW 103 (De Luca et al. 2006).\\nFree precession in a flaring magnetar or luminous radio pulsar has also been suggested to explain the periodicity.\\n(Levin et al. 2020; Zanazzi & Lai 2020; Katz 2021). This model predicts an increase in the period as the neutron\\nRate and morphology evolution of FRB 20180916B\\n15\\nstar spins down with time. Our upper limit, ˙\\nP < 1.5 × 10−4, implies a lower limit on the spin-down age >\\n∼150 yr, or\\nequivalently B >\\n∼5 × 1014 G assuming standard magnetic braking (Levin et al. 2020; Katz 2021). These constraints\\nwill improve with time, although as noted by Katz (2021), the lower limit on the (unknown) spin-down age is not\\nconstraining, since the latter is generally interpreted as an upper limit on the true age. Additionally, in such models,\\na shorter timescale periodicity from the rotation of the compact object itself is expected to be present, possibly on the\\norder of seconds as for Galactic magnetars (e.g. Olausen & Kaspi 2014). This has not yet been seen, though detection\\ncould be hindered by timing noise or glitches in the case of a very young magnetar (e.g. Kaspi et al. 2000; Gavriil et al.\\n2008).\\nTo explain the chromatic nature of the burst arrival times from FRB 20180916B , Li & Zanazzi (2021), suggest\\naltitude-dependent emission from a magnetar, which can be precessing or have a long spin period. For a rotating\\nmagnetar, the model predicts a constant position angle at similar phases, but for a precessing system, the position\\nangle can vary at fixed phase. In addition the spin down rate could help distinguish between the two possibilities,\\nsince it is expected to be much larger in the case of free precession (Li & Zanazzi 2021).\\nRecently Zhao et al. (2023) proposed a precessing magnetar in orbit with a Be-star for FRB 20180916B , to explain\\nits latest RM evolution. In this case, the 16.3-day period is due to a precessing or rotating magnetar, but it is in\\na binary orbit of ∼1000–20,000 days. In the model, the magnetar is undergoing a periastron passage, resulting in a\\nsecular rise in RM due to interaction with the disk of the Be-star. Stochastic RM variations in this model are due\\nto clumps in the stellar winds/disk interacting with the FRB. However, DM and scattering variations correlated with\\nRM are expected in this model, yet our observations show no evidence for this.\\nForced precession due to a fallback disk has also been proposed to explain the observed periodicity (Tong et al.\\n2020). Here a shorter rotational periodicity from the compact object is also expected. This model does not obviously\\naccount for chromatic periodicity (Li & Zanazzi 2021), and a range of polarization position angle values is expected,\\nbut has not been observed (Mckinven et al. 2023; Nimmo et al. 2021). The forced precession fallback disk model is\\nthus not favored by the data. The model predicts that the observed period should increase as the disk dissipates,\\nsuch that ˙\\nP = −P/tdiss, where tdiss is the unknown dissipation timescale (Katz 2021). Our constraint on ˙\\nP implies\\ntdiss >\\n∼300 yr.\\nAnother model involves geodetic precession in a relativistic orbit.\\nYang & Zou (2020) propose a neutron star\\nprecessing in a tight orbit with a companion (orbital period ∼100–1000 s). This system would be short-lived, and a\\ndecrease in the period and a change in burst rate would be expected as the orbit decays. However, the timescale of\\nthis decay could range from hundreds to millions of years (van Haaften et al. 2012; Katz 2021), depending strongly on\\nthe distance between objects and their masses. Our current period derivative limit of 1.5 × 10−4 days/day suggests\\nthat we will start probing interesting phase space (e.g. mass ratios of unity and a neutron-star mass) in just a few\\nyears.\\nThe last precessional model we consider here is a compact object in an ultra luminous X-ray binary (ULXB)\\nundergoing super-Eddington mass transfer (Sridhar et al. 2021). Here, the precession of the polar accretion funnel\\nresults in periodic FRB emission. In this case, a systematic variation in DM of ∼0.1–1 pc cm−3 and am RM of ∼0.5–\\n1 rad m−2 with activity phase is expected, depending on the parameters for the quiescent jet, taking into consideration\\nthe optical depth needed for FRB to escape. As shown in Figure 6, we constrain ∆DM ⪅1 pc cm−3 within the activity\\nphase. However, this model does not naturally explain the observed evolution in RM if the variation is due to changes\\nin the immediate emission environment. Moreover, a ‘turn-off’ in emission is predicted on a timescale of years, perhaps\\nfollowed by the appearance of an optical/IR counterpart.\\n4.4.2. Binary Motion as Origin of Periodicity\\nThe source of the radio bursts in FRB 20180916B has been suggested to be in different types of binary orbits in order\\nto explain the observed 16.34-day periodicity.\\nLyutikov et al. (2020) suggested a pulsar in orbit with an O/B type star, and Li et al. (2021b) suggested FRB\\nemission from star quakes occurring due to stress on the neutron star surface by accreting material from a Be star\\ncompanion. Ioka & Zhang (2020) proposed a highly magnetised pulsar whose magnetic field is ‘combed’ by a strong\\nwind from a massive companion star, resulting in FRB emission. Wada et al. (2021) made additional alterations\\nto the model to explain the chromatic periodicity, by proposing variations in emitting frequency with phase due to\\nthe influx of aurora particles at different phases of the orbit. Deng et al. (2021) consider an accreting system with\\na compact object generating FRBs by the synchrotron maser mechanism.\\nWang et al. (2022) explained the RM\\n16\\nSand et al.\\nvariations observed in FRB 20201124A and FRB 20190520B using an eccentric magnetar/Be star binary model. Here,\\na Be-star has a magnetized decretion disk, and when its binary companion magnetar approaches periastron, the radio\\nwaves interact with the disk, resulting in the observed RM variation.\\nSuch models naturally predict DM and scattering time variations with phase, which we do not see. We can look to\\nGalactic neutron-star/OB binary systems for indications of the expected sizes of DM or scattering variations due to\\nchanges in location of the radio source within the companion wind. Johnston et al. (2001) studied the highly eccentric\\n(e = 0.87) 3.4-yr radio pulsar/Be star binary PSR B1259−63, which exhibited DM variations of over ∼10 pc cm−3,\\nand scattering times that ranged from 0.1 to nearly 10 ms at 1.5 GHz, both correlated with orbital phase. Similarly,\\nAndersen et al. (2023) studied the CHIME/FRB-discovered pulsar/OBe star binary PSR J2108+4516, which has an\\norbital period 269 days and eccentricity 0.09, showing that the pulsar exhibited DM variations of amplitude ∼4 pc cm−3,\\nand scattering times ranging from well under 1 ms to over 20 ms in the CHIME band, both also correlated with orbital\\nphase. The latter system, with only modest eccentricity (0.09), has a projected semi-major axis of over 800 light\\nseconds, implying only modest proximity of the two objects.\\nIn FRB 20180916B , by contrast, we do not observe any such correlated DM or scattering variations, in spite of\\nstrong modulation of the burst rate. On the whole, this argues against a binary orbit with a massive star as the origin\\nof the periodicity in FRB 20180916B ’s burst rate.\\nWe note that a massive companion with a weak wind might be invoked to explain the lack of scattering and DM\\nvariability. This has been observed for the pulsar binary PSR J0045−7319 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)\\n(Kaspi et al. 1996). Here the apparent low mass-loss rate of the companion, as implied by the absence of any DM\\nvariation in spite of a highly eccentric orbit and great proximity of the sources at periastron, is explained as a result of\\nthe low metallicity of the SMC, and the fact that OB stars have radiatively driven winds that make use of metals for\\nthe mass-loss mechanism. However, the host galaxy of FRB 20180916B has a metallicity similar to that of the Milky\\nWay, which suggests that any binary companion to FRB 20180916B would have a wind with Milky Way-type metal\\nabundances (Marcote et al. 2020).\\nThese models also predict a longer activity window at higher frequencies, which has not been observed and which\\nalso cannot easily explain the chromatic nature of the periodicity.\\nFinally, a neutron star in orbit with a magnetized white dwarf has been argued to produce FRB emission by\\naccretion (Gu et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2022). This model requires a highly eccentric orbit to explain the duty cycle\\nfor FRB 20180916B . Dai & Zhong (2020) propose an old, slowly spinning pulsar captured by a star interacting with\\nan extragalactic asteroid belt. Here interaction of asteroids with the magnetosphere of the neutron star leads to FRB\\nemission. However, the recent dramatic long-term rise in RM is not naturally explained in this model.\\nOverall, the origin of the periodicity in FRB 20180916B remains a mystery, with our observations providing key new\\nconstraints that further challenge existing models.\\n5. CONCLUSION\\nIn this study, we report a morphological analysis of 60 bursts observed from the periodic Fast Radio Burst source\\nFRB 20180916B , using data from CHIME/FRB from 2018 August to 2021 December. Out of these, 45 bursts were\\nrecorded with high-time resolution baseband data, which enabled us to study their properties in detail. We present\\na comprehensive outline of our pulse morphology pipeline, which has been integrated into the baseband processing\\nsystem, and employ it to measure the DM and spectro-temporal properties of the bursts in our dataset.\\nOur analysis reveals that the variation in DM for FRB 20180916B is constrained to be ⪅1 pc cm−3, in agreement\\nwith findings from other telescopes operating at different wavelengths. Furthermore, we measured scattering times,\\nand found evidence for variation from burst to burst, ranging from ∼0.16 to over 2 ms, although in some cases\\nunresolved microstructure may impact the measurement. We find no evidence for a correlation of scattering time\\nwith the phase of the 16-day cycle. The lack of phase-dependent DM or scattering times seems at odds with models\\nfor the periodicity involving a binary orbit around a massive star. Additionally, we found no correlation between\\nany morphological property and the reported secular RM increase of the source (Mckinven et al. 2023). We also\\nestimated the source activity period and provided constraints on the period derivative. Our analysis shows that the\\nactivity period of the source has remained unchanged, with a value of 16.34 ± 0.07 days, and the period derivative is\\nconstrained to be −0.2 ± 1.5 × 10−4 day day−1. The burst count of the source in each activity cycle was found to be\\nconsistent with a Poisson process, and the rate of the source showed no significant variation over our observation of 74\\nactivity cycles. Unlike other prolific repeaters, FRB 20180916B appears stable in its emission and has not exhibited any\\nRate and morphology evolution of FRB 20180916B\\n17\\nheightened activity above our detection threshold. We also discussed and provided constraints on various isolated and\\nbinary models proposed to explain the periodic nature of the source. FRB 20180916B is an exciting puzzle, and further\\nmeasurements of RM, DM, and scattering will hopefully provide insights into the evolution of the source environment\\nand further constrain these models. Monitoring the source daily over an extended period will play a crucial role in\\nthis study, and CHIME/FRB is well-positioned to undertake this task.\\nCHIME is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Syilx/Okanagan people.\\nWe thank the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory, operated by the National Research Council Canada, for\\ngracious hospitality and expertise.\\nCHIME is funded by a grant from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) 2012 Leading Edge Fund (Project\\n31170) and by contributions from the provinces of British Columbia, Qu´\\nebec and Ontario.

Topocentric TOAs are in Modified Julian Date (MJD) format,\\nreferenced at 400 MHz with ∼1 second precision. P corresponds to the phase of the burst folded at 16.34 days with reference\\nMJD 58369.40. D is the downsampling factor at which we measured the properties (i.e. time resolution = D × 2.56 µs). DM\\nis the dispersion measure reported by fitburst. τ is the scattering timescale referenced at 600 MHz. σ is the intrinsic widths\\nof all the sub-bursts at 600 MHz. ∆ν corresponds to the bandwidth of the detection. See Sec. 3.1 for details.\\nCHIME/FRB Collaboration, Andersen, B. C., Bandura, K.,\\net al. 2023, ApJ, 947, 83, doi: 10.3847/1538-4357/acc6c1\\nCordes, J.

This connection is crucial for understanding the system's band topology. (Reference 1)\\n* **Potential for other phases:**  Depending on the filling factor, twisted MoTe2 might also exhibit magnetism and charge order. (Reference 43) Transitions from quantum Hall states to other phases are also possible.
